# Architectural Patterns for Ionic Smart Home Apps: Supabase Integration, Security, Offline/Sync, Background Processing, Realtime, Notifications, and Deployment

## Executive Summary

Smart home applications built with Ionic and Capacitor can deliver a cross-platform experience without sacrificing the real-time responsiveness, offline resilience, and secure integrations that the domain demands. The central architectural choices revolve around how you wire the Ionic UI layer to a secure backend, protect secrets, handle intermittent connectivity, process background automations, and coordinate realtime updates and push notifications across mobile and web.

This report recommends a layered architecture that keeps the Ionic UI and Capacitor webview as the presentation layer, places a Supabase backend as the orchestration and persistence plane, and exposes smart home devices and services through a dedicated integration layer. Supabase contributes PostgreSQL as the source of truth, GoTrue for authentication, PostgREST for CRUD, Realtime for low-latency updates, Storage for media, and Edge Functions as a safe execution context for sensitive logic and third-party calls. The mobile app reads from and writes to this backend via Row Level Security (RLS)-enforced APIs, while background tasks and push notifications coordinate automations and user awareness. This composition offers a pragmatic balance between developer velocity, security, and operational control, especially when combined with a unified PWA and native app deployment strategy from a single codebase.[^1][^2]

Key recommendations:
- Integrate Ionic with Supabase using an RLS-first posture, and move any third-party smart home calls that require secrets into Supabase Edge Functions. Supabase’s Auth issues JWTs that align with Postgres RLS policies; PostgREST serves CRUD while Realtime provides Broadcast, Presence, and Postgres Changes for live features.[^1][^8][^19]
- Never hardcode third-party secrets in the client. Store long-lived secrets server-side and issue short-lived, scoped tokens to the client. For sensitive mobile interactions, use server-mediated ephemeral secrets and avoid persistent storage of any credentials; protect data in transit with TLS and consider certificate pinning where risk warrants it.[^11][^28][^13]
- Adopt an offline-first model: the mobile app treats local storage as the primary interface during outages, with a background sync engine and clear conflict-resolution policies. Use IndexedDB or SQLite for local data, service workers for PWA caching, and network listeners to adapt behavior.[^10][^15][^16]
- Use background processing judiciously. Prefer cloud-side automations via Supabase functions and scheduled jobs for reliability, with Capacitor Background Runner used for short-lived tasks like lightweight polling or geofence checks subject to OS constraints.[^7][^29]
- Combine Supabase Realtime for in-app live updates with platform push notifications (FCM/APNs) via Capacitor for time-critical alerts, carefully designing action payloads and deep links.[^8][^14][^9]
- Ship a unified PWA plus native apps from one codebase. PWAs excel for acquisition and frictionless updates; native stores deliver device-level features and discovery. Plan feature parity and distribution accordingly, including a mobile web–first approach when reach matters most.[^2][^17][^18]

Deployment decision framing: prioritize a PWA for reach and fast iteration, and use native builds for background execution, push notifications, and store presence. Maintain feature parity through capability detection and graceful degradation (e.g., background tasks and push require native, while realtime and offline caching work across PWA and native).[^2][^17][^7][^14]

Information gaps to note:
- Provider-specific smart home APIs (e.g., Matter/Thread/Zigbee/Z-Wave details, HomeKit APIs) are out of scope; the security and integration patterns here are vendor-neutral.
- Some Supabase client nuances and Background Runner scheduling specifics evolve; verify constraints and latest behavior against official docs during implementation.
- Pricing for Supabase Realtime and service worker caches on iOS/Android PWAs are not covered here.
- Detailed geofencing plugins and precise OS scheduling limits vary by OS version and device; treat them as design-time risks to be validated.

The rest of this document provides a detailed reference architecture, security design, offline-first and sync patterns, background processing guidance, realtime and notifications strategy, deployment trade-offs, and an implementation roadmap.

## Reference Architecture for an Ionic Smart Home App

A robust Ionic smart home app benefits from a layered design that separates concerns across UI, local data, backend services, device integrations, and cross-cutting capabilities like background processing and observability. The architecture balances a consistent cross-platform user interface with the operational realities of device control, intermittent connectivity, and privacy.

To situate Supabase services within this stack, it helps to see how responsibilities align across layers.

To illustrate the composition, Table 1 maps each architectural layer to its primary technologies and responsibilities.

Table 1: Architecture layer-to-technology mapping

| Layer | Primary technologies | Responsibilities | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Presentation (Ionic UI) | Ionic Framework; Angular/React/Vue | Screens, navigation, theming, gestures; renders device status and controls | Runs in Capacitor webview on mobile; browser in PWA mode[^19] |
| Local data and caching | IndexedDB/SQLite; service workers | Local persistence for device state, scenes, logs; asset caching | IndexedDB for structured data; service workers for PWA asset/network proxy[^10][^16][^15] |
| Integration and orchestration | Supabase: Auth (GoTrue), PostgREST, Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions | Authentication; CRUD; realtime features; file storage; server-side logic | Postgres at the core; Realtime for Broadcast/Presence/Postgres Changes; Edge Functions for sensitive calls[^1][^8] |
| Device/smart home APIs | Vendor cloud and local protocols (generic) | Device commissioning, telemetry, command execution | OAuth-based account linking; protocol specifics abstracted[^4] |
| Cross-cutting capabilities | Push (FCM/APNs), Background Runner | Alerts, deep links; short background tasks | Use background tasks for lightweight polling, geofences; prefer cloud automations[^14][^7][^29] |
| Observability and delivery | Appflow Live Updates; CI/CD | Monitoring, live updates, build/deploy pipelines | Live updates for web assets; native builds for store releases[^3][^26] |

Supabase services map naturally to these concerns. Auth provides JWT-based sessions and aligns with Postgres RLS, PostgREST serves CRUD under RLS policies, Realtime distributes live updates, Storage manages device images or logs, and Edge Functions provide a secure execution layer for token exchanges and third-party API calls that must not be exposed client-side.[^1][^8]

### Layered Architecture Overview

The Ionic UI lives in the Capacitor webview on iOS/Android and in the browser for PWA. It renders device status panels, scene controls, and historical logs, while delegating data flow to a local repository and a sync engine. The local data store (IndexedDB or SQLite) acts as the app’s “ground truth” during offline periods, buffering user actions and telemetry until connectivity returns. Service workers—where available—act as a programmable network proxy to cache static assets and selected API responses, reducing load times and enabling offline experiences.[^10][^16][^15]

The Supabase backend exposes secure, RLS-protected APIs, and streams realtime updates to subscribed clients. Device or vendor cloud integrations occur through Edge Functions, which hold long-lived secrets, perform OAuth token exchanges, and enforce server-side authorization. Push notifications and background tasks complement cloud automations by handling user-facing alerts and periodic checks on mobile.

### Supabase Integration Anchors

- Authentication (GoTrue). Supabase Auth issues JWTs that encode the user’s identity. Configure JWT expiry and refresh strategy to balance security with usability. Align claims with RLS policies to ensure per-user isolation by default.[^1]
- PostgREST CRUD. Expose tables and views as REST endpoints under RLS; treat them as the default read/write surface for the client. Write policies that enforce least privilege and minimize server-side exceptions.[^1]
- Realtime. Use Broadcast for low-latency ephemeral signals (e.g., user typing, quick toggle confirmations), Presence to track active sessions or online household members, and Postgres Changes to react to device state or log mutations in real time.[^8]
- Edge Functions. Execute sensitive operations like third-party token exchanges, device commissioning handshakes, or server-to-server calls that require secrets. Keep long-lived credentials and signing keys exclusively server-side.[^1]

### Device Integration Layer

Most smart home providers require OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow for account linking, with HTTPS-based authorization and token exchange endpoints and optional UserInfo for profile claims. Commissioning patterns may include QR-based setup, near-field handshakes, or device flow when the device has limited input. Abstract the provider specifics behind Edge Functions so the mobile app never handles long-lived secrets.[^4][^24]

Customize device-side capabilities via Capacitor plugins where native APIs are needed for discovery or commissioning, such as scanning for devices on local networks or reading NFC tags. Keep plugins small, idiomatic, and consistent across platforms to reduce maintenance and store review risk.[^12]

---

## Security Architecture for Hybrid Smart Home Apps

Security must be approached from first principles: assume the client environment is untrusted, the network is hostile, and any secrets embedded in the app can be extracted. The controls should enforce least privilege, protect tokens and keys at rest and in transit, and push sensitive logic server-side.

Threats to address include API key extraction, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, tampering with the app binary or runtime, and privacy leakage through logs or caches. Mobile-specific threats also include rooted/jailbroken devices and emulator detection evasion. Design the app to be resilient under these conditions: rotate credentials, monitor anomalies, and fail closed by default.[^11][^28][^13][^30]

To make the threat model concrete, Table 2 summarizes key risks, the controls that mitigate them, and where those controls are implemented.

Table 2: Threat model and mitigations

| Threat | Description | Primary mitigations | Implementation layer |
|---|---|---|---|
| API key/secret extraction | Attacker reverses app binaries orinspects assets to recover secrets | No hardcoded secrets; server-side long-lived credentials; short-lived scoped tokens to clients; AES/RSA envelope for ephemeral secrets; zero secrets in PWA | Edge Functions; server; client receives only ephemeral tokens[^11][^30] |
| Session hijacking | Intercept or replay tokens | Short-lived access tokens; refresh token rotation; TLS; optional certificate pinning; secure token storage | Server; network; mobile Keychain/Keystore[^11][^28] |
| Man-in-the-middle (MitM) | Interception of network traffic | TLS everywhere; strict certificate validation; avoid mixed content; pinning for high-risk contexts | Network; client; server[^11][^28][^13] |
| App tampering/runtime hooking | Modified app or runtime instrumentation | Obfuscation; root/jailbreak detection; runtime self-checks; integrity attestation (e.g., Play Integrity/App Attest) | Client; server verification[^11] |
| Privilege escalation via APIs | Over-broad access due to weak RLS or missing checks | RLS on all tables; scoped JWT claims; backend authorization checks for sensitive operations | Postgres/PostgREST; Edge Functions[^1][^11] |
| Privacy leakage via caches/logs | Sensitive data persists in caches or logs | Mask sensitive data; avoid caching secrets; limit logging; use ephemeral storage for secrets | Client; service workers; server[^11][^16] |

Secure credential handling follows a strict separation of duties. Table 3 outlines where each type of secret lives, how it is used, and how it is protected.

Table 3: Secret handling matrix

| Credential type | Owner/issuer | Stored where | Transmitted how | Rotation policy | Expiry |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Supabase service role key | Supabase project | Server/Edge Functions only | Server-to-server | Rotate per operational policy; never expose to clients | N/A |
| Supabase anon key | Supabase project | Client config (public) | HTTPS | Rotate per project policy | N/A (public by design) |
| Third-party OAuth client secret | Your auth server / provider | Server/Edge Functions only | Server-to-server over HTTPS | Rotate on compromise and per provider guidance | N/A |
| Access token (short-lived) | Your auth server (JWT) | Mobile secure storage (Keychain/Keystore) | HTTPS Authorization header | Refresh via refresh token; short TTL | Minutes to hours (policy-driven) |
| Refresh token (long-lived) | Your auth server | Server securely; optional device-bound copy if needed | Not exposed to JS; server uses to mint access tokens | Rotate on use; revoke on suspicion | Long-lived, revocable |
| Ephemeral API key (client-scoped) | Edge Function | In-memory only in client | HTTPS | Issued per session; very short TTL | Minutes (design-time) |

### Credential Handling and API Key Storage

Do not embed long-lived secrets in the client. Keep them server-side and issue short-lived, scoped tokens instead. For rare cases where a client must temporarily hold an API key, encrypt it using a hybrid envelope: generate a random AES key to encrypt the payload, then encrypt the AES key with the server’s public key; store only the encrypted payload and the encrypted AES key. Decrypt the AES key server-side and return it to the client for in-memory decryption of the payload. This ensures the client never persistently stores the plaintext secret and never embeds the AES key. Apply the same philosophy to OAuth tokens: treat refresh tokens as sensitive, keep them server-side when possible, and use device-bound secure storage for any client-held token artifacts.[^30][^11]

### Transport and Platform Security

All network traffic must use TLS. Avoid mixed content, do not override certificate validation, and use strong cipher suites. For high-risk environments, consider certificate pinning alongside standard validation to reduce the probability of interception. On mobile, use hardware-backed keystores (Secure Enclave on iOS, StrongBox/Keystore on Android) for storing cryptographic keys. Complement this with runtime protections such as obfuscation, root/jailbreak detection, and server-side integrity checks (e.g., Play Integrity on Android, App Attest on iOS). These measures raise the cost of tampering and help detect anomalous usage patterns.[^11][^28][^13]

### OAuth Flows for Smart Home Integrations

Google Smart Home’s cloud-to-cloud integrations require the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow, with separate HTTPS endpoints for authorization and token exchange. The flow uses short-lived authorization codes, short-lived access tokens (typically about an hour), and long-lived refresh tokens for renewal. A UserInfo endpoint may be required when linking Google accounts with your service’s accounts. The design emphasizes explicit user consent, strict redirect validation, and token integrity.[^4]

For devices with limited input capabilities, use the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant. The device presents a user code and verification URI; the user authenticates on a secondary device, while the device polls for the authorization result. This pattern is ideal for screens, thermostats, and other headless gadgets. Ensure polling intervals and error handling follow the specification, and debounce to avoid server overload.[^24]

Table 4 summarizes endpoints and token characteristics in these flows.

Table 4: OAuth endpoints and token lifetimes

| Flow | Endpoints | Token types | Typical lifetimes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authorization Code | Authorization; Token exchange; optional UserInfo | Authorization code; Access token; Refresh token | Code: minutes; Access: ~1 hour; Refresh: long-lived | Validate client_id, redirect_uri, state; strict HTTPS; consent UX critical[^4] |
| Device Authorization | Device authorization; Token exchange | Device code; User code; Access token; Refresh token | Polling interval provided; Access token TTL as issued; Refresh token optional | For limited-input devices; handle authorization_pending; out-of-band user auth[^24] |

## Offline Capability and Data Synchronization

Smart home interactions must remain coherent under poor connectivity. Users expect immediate feedback in the UI even when the network is unstable, and automations should not fail because the phone is offline. An offline-first approach achieves this by treating the local store as the app’s primary interface during outages, with a background sync engine that reconciles changes when connectivity returns.

A practical pattern is to pre-cache static assets with service workers and use IndexedDB or SQLite for structured data. Network listeners monitor connectivity and quality; the UI surfaces online/offline states explicitly and gates features that require a network. Sync runs in the background, with versioned records and conflict resolution rules (e.g., last write wins for minor state, user choice for critical actions).[^10][^16][^15]

To ground storage choices, Table 5 compares common local persistence options and when to use them.

Table 5: Local storage options comparison

| Option | Encryption support | Capacity | Performance | Offline readiness | Best-fit use cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| localStorage | None by default | Small | High for simple key–value | Basic | Feature flags, non-sensitive preferences |
| IndexedDB | App-managed encryption; browser-managed at rest | Large | Good for structured data | Strong | Device logs, queues, structured caches[^16] |
| SQLite (via Ionic/Capacitor) | Hardware-backed options on mobile; can combine with app-level encryption | Large | High for queries | Strong | Primary local DB for device state, scenes, history |

Service workers provide a network proxy for caching and offline serving. Choose strategies per resource type. Table 6 outlines common strategies and suitable scenarios.

Table 6: Service worker caching strategies

| Strategy | Behavior | Pros | Cons | Suitable scenarios |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cache-first | Serve from cache; fall back to network | Fast, offline-capable | Stale content risk | Static assets, icons, fonts[^16][^15] |
| Network-first | Try network; fall back to cache | Fresh data when online | Slower on poor networks | User profile, dashboard data[^16][^15] |
| Stale-while-revalidate | Serve cached immediately; update cache in background | Good UX; refreshes silently | Complexity | News feeds, non-critical lists[^16][^15] |
| Cache-only | Serve only from cache | Predictable | No freshness | Offline screens, help content[^16][^15] |
| Network-only | Always fetch | Fresh | Offline failure | Auth endpoints, tokens[^16][^15] |

### Offline-First Principles

An offline-first app caches early and often, but it also communicates limits to users. Identify features that cannot work offline and make that visible via toasts or banners. Plan for conflicts: define rules for what merges automatically and what requires user review. Test real-world conditions, including captive portals and switching between Wi‑Fi and cellular; observe user behavior to calibrate sync cadence and cache scope.[^10]

### Local Persistence and Sync Engine

Use IndexedDB for structured data in PWAs and a SQLite-backed store in native builds for performance and stronger encryption options. Model records with version stamps, origins, and per-entity IDs to support deterministic merges. Maintain a per-entity sync status (dirty, pending, lastSyncedAt) to prioritize uploads. When connectivity changes, the sync engine should flush queues in priority order, handling retries with exponential backoff.[^16]

### PWA Caching and Update Strategy

Register a service worker to pre-cache critical shells and defer non-essential resources. During activation, clean up outdated caches. Adopt a clear update strategy so users are not surprised by silent changes; prompt when the new service worker is ready and communicate what changed. If a background refresh is used, throttle it to avoid battery drain and ensure it does not race with foreground usage.[^16]

---

## Background Processing for Automation Triggers

Not all automation belongs on the device. Mobile OSs impose strict constraints on background execution to preserve battery life and user experience. A sound approach favors cloud-side automations for reliability and uses Capacitor Background Runner for short-lived tasks that must run locally.

Background Runner allows custom JavaScript to run in the background for polling, notifications, and light geolocation tasks. You configure an event and an interval in Capacitor’s settings, register the relevant iOS BGTask identifiers, and declare Android permissions. Be aware that iOS may execute tasks much less frequently than requested; design idempotent tasks that tolerate delay and avoid time-sensitive assumptions. For longer-running or mission-critical automations, run the logic in Supabase Edge Functions or scheduled jobs.[^7][^29]

Table 7 compares options for background execution.

Table 7: Background execution options matrix

| Option | Reliability | Latency | Constraints | Best use cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Capacitor Background Runner | Medium (OS-dependent) | Unpredictable on iOS | Short tasks; OS may throttle; platform permissions | Periodic polling; local notifications; geofence checks[^7][^29] |
| Edge Functions (cloud) | High | Server-side scheduling | Requires connectivity | Timed automations; device command execution; webhooks[^1] |
| Platform-native services | High when correctly configured | Varies | More native complexity | Critical background work with tighter OS integration (use native where needed) |

### Use-Case Alignment for Automations

- Local-only actions. Trigger notifications or update widgets when the app is foregrounded or briefly backgrounded, with minimal latency requirements. Background Runner can schedule these tasks.[^7]
- Cloud-driven automations. Execute time-based triggers, device state changes, and cross-user household events in Edge Functions. This avoids OS throttling and delivers consistent behavior across devices.[^1]
- Geofencing and presence. Use Capacitor geolocation to detect presence transitions or geofences and enqueue local actions or cloud commands. Expect variability in execution frequency; design conservatively.[^7]

## Real-Time Updates and Push Notifications

Smart home apps thrive on immediacy: toggling a switch should reflect in the UI instantly, and critical alerts should arrive even when the app is not active. Supabase Realtime and platform push notifications serve complementary roles.

Use Supabase Realtime for in-app live features: Broadcast for ephemeral signals, Presence to show who is online, and Postgres Changes to subscribe to table mutations. In the UI, subscribe to channels per page or per household, update the local store, and render changes optimistically. For time-critical alerts that must reach users when the app is backgrounded or closed, use platform push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android; Apple Push Notification Service via FCM for iOS) and design actionable payloads and deep links for clarity.[^8][^14][^9]

Table 8 compares realtime channels and notification delivery.

Table 8: Realtime channels vs push notifications

| Capability | Trigger | Delivery | Latency | Device state | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Broadcast (Realtime) | App events | In-app WebSocket | Low | Foreground/background (app alive) | Typing indicators, quick toggle acks[^8] |
| Presence (Realtime) | Session lifecycle | In-app WebSocket | Low | Foreground/background (app alive) | Online household members[^8] |
| Postgres Changes (Realtime) | DB mutations | In-app WebSocket | Low | Foreground/background (app alive) | Live device state, logs[^8] |
| Push notifications (FCM/APNs) | Server-side campaigns | OS notification tray | Seconds to minutes | Background/closed | Critical alerts; actionable deep links[^14][^9] |

### Supabase Realtime Patterns

Partition channels by household and by UI concerns to avoid over-subscription. For example, subscribe to a device’s state table when the device detail page is open, and unsubscribe on navigation away. Handle presence to show active controllers (who is currently adjusting the thermostat). On mutation events, update the local store and reconcile with any pending offline changes to avoid UI flicker or double-apply.[^8]

### Push Notifications Implementation

Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging for both Android and iOS (via APNs). Request permission with a pre-permission explanation to improve opt-in rates, and register the device token early in the app lifecycle. Use data payloads for deep links and custom actions, and handle the pushNotificationActionPerformed event to navigate users directly to the relevant screen, even from a closed app state.[^14][^9]

---

## Deployment Strategies: Native App Stores vs PWA

Shipping a PWA and native apps from one Ionic codebase is not only feasible but often the fastest route to broad reach. A PWA-first approach leverages search engine acquisition and frictionless updates, while native builds in the app stores provide device-level capabilities (background execution, push) and store discovery. The debate is a false dichotomy; with Capacitor you can have both from one codebase and choose the right channel per feature and audience.[^2][^17]

PWAs benefit from service workers for caching and offline support, but background execution and push support differ across platforms and OS versions. Native builds provide more predictable access to background tasks and push via platform SDKs. For team operations, consider Ionic Appflow Live Updates to deploy web assets without store review cycles, while native binaries still follow store processes.[^18][^3]

Table 9 compares deployment channels.

Table 9: Channel matrix—PWA vs iOS/Android native

| Dimension | PWA | iOS/Android native |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery | Search engines, web links | App stores, OEM channels |
| Install friction | Low (web) | Medium (stores) |
| Background tasks | Limited/varies by OS | Supported via OS APIs |
| Push notifications | Supported in modern browsers with caveats | Full via FCM/APNs[^14] |
| Offline support | Strong via service workers | Strong via local DB and native caches[^16][^18] |
| Update cadence | Instant (server-side) | Store approvals for binary; web asset updates possible via Live Updates[^3] |
| Feature parity | Good for UI/realtime | Required for background/push |
| Analytics-ready | Web analytics + client SDKs | Native analytics SDKs |

### Strategy Selection Criteria

Choose PWA-first when your primary goal is reach, rapid iteration, and lightweight distribution, especially for utility features that do not require background execution. Choose native-first when you depend on reliable background tasks, push notifications, or store presence. Many teams adopt a dual strategy: PWA for acquisition and simple controls, and native apps for advanced automations and alerts.[^2][^17]

### Release Management

Automate builds and deploy web assets continuously. For native updates, combine CI pipelines with Live Updates for web layer changes to reduce store churn and still deliver rapid bug fixes. Use feature flags to manage progressive exposure and mitigate risk across platforms. Establish rollback strategies that work across both web and native release channels.[^26][^3]

---

## Implementation Roadmap and Sample Flows

A staged approach reduces risk and builds confidence across security, offline behavior, and realtime features.

Phase 1: Foundations and security
- Initialize the Ionic app with Capacitor and configure a Supabase project. Implement Auth and enforce RLS policies across all tables. Integrate platform secure storage for tokens and consider certificate pinning for high-risk contexts. Complete a threat model and implement the secret-handling patterns described earlier.[^19][^1][^11][^28]

Phase 2: Offline-first and sync
- Add local persistence (IndexedDB or SQLite). Implement a repository pattern that treats the local store as the default source of truth. Introduce a sync engine with versioned records, conflict policies, and network listeners. Add service workers for PWA caching and offline shells.[^10][^16][^15]

Phase 3: Realtime and push
- Subscribe to Supabase Realtime channels for in-app updates and presence. Integrate FCM/APNs via Capacitor for push notifications, including deep linking from notification payloads. Design an alerting taxonomy (info, warning, critical) and map notifications accordingly.[^8][^14][^9]

Phase 4: Background automations
- Add Capacitor Background Runner for local polling and notifications. Move time-critical automations to Edge Functions to avoid OS throttling. Validate behavior under real network conditions and document expected latency for each automation.[^7][^1][^29]

Phase 5: Device onboarding and OAuth
- Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with Edge Functions for token exchanges and secret storage. Add device commissioning UX and, when applicable, use the OAuth 2.0 Device Flow for limited-input devices. Abstract provider-specific protocols behind Edge Functions.[^4][^24]

Phase 6: Deployment and observability
- Configure CI/CD for PWA and native builds. Use Live Updates to push web changes without store review. Instrument telemetry for errors, performance, and security events. Establish a release playbook with feature flags and rollback procedures.[^3][^26]

To make sequencing concrete, Table 10 outlines milestones and acceptance criteria.

Table 10: Milestones and acceptance criteria

| Phase | Milestone | Key acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Auth + RLS enabled | Users can sign in; RLS blocks unauthorized access; tokens stored securely; TLS enforced end-to-end[^1][^11] |
| 2 | Offline-first baseline | App usable offline for core screens; sync reconciles changes; service worker caches essential assets[^10][^16][^15] |
| 3 | Realtime + push | Device state updates live in-app; push notifications arrive and deep-link correctly; presence shown[^8][^14][^9] |
| 4 | Background automations | Local background tasks run within OS constraints; cloud automations trigger reliably[^7][^1][^29] |
| 5 | Account linking | OAuth flows complete; device commissioning UX works; Edge Functions hold secrets server-side[^4][^24] |
| 6 | Release + observability | CI/CD in place; Live Updates deploy web assets; telemetry captured; rollback plan documented[^3][^26] |

## Security Considerations Checklist for Smart Home APIs

- Authentication and authorization
  - Use OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code for account linking; validate client_id, redirect_uri, and state parameters strictly; enforce short-lived codes and access tokens, with refresh tokens as needed.[^4]
  - For limited-input devices, adopt Device Authorization Grant with proper polling and error handling.[^24]
  - Align JWT claims with RLS policies; never trust client-side roles or scopes without server-side checks.[^1][^11]

- Secret management
  - Keep third-party client secrets and long-lived keys server-side; issue short-lived, scoped tokens to clients.[^11][^28]
  - Use hybrid encryption (AES+RSA) for any ephemeral secrets handed to clients; decrypt in memory only; avoid persistent storage of sensitive values.[^30]

- Data protection
  - Use TLS everywhere; avoid mixed content; consider certificate pinning in high-risk contexts.[^11][^28][^13]
  - Minimize PII collection; prefer ephemeral identifiers; rotate tokens regularly; mask sensitive fields in logs and UI.[^11]

- Runtime integrity and platform controls
  - Implement root/jailbreak detection and runtime self-checks; use platform attestation (Play Integrity, App Attest) and verify server-side.[^11]
  - Store tokens in platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore); avoid storing credentials in plist or SharedPreferences.[^11]

- App and supply chain hygiene
  - Obfuscate code; pin dependencies; monitor CVEs; implement signed updates with rollback capability.[^11]

Table 11 maps common threats to specific controls.

Table 11: Threats-to-controls mapping

| Threat | Control | References |
|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded secrets exposure | Server-side secrets only; ephemeral tokens; AES/RSA envelope; no secrets in PWA | [^11][^30] |
| Token replay/interception | Short-lived tokens; TLS; pinning; secure storage | [^11][^28][^13] |
| Lateral privilege escalation | RLS everywhere; backend authorization checks | [^1][^11] |
| Runtime tampering | Obfuscation; root/jailbreak detection; attestation | [^11] |
| MitM | TLS; certificate validation; pinning | [^11][^28][^13] |
| Supply chain compromise | Dependency pinning; signed updates; monitoring | [^11] |
