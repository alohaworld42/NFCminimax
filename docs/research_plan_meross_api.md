# Meross Cloud API Research Plan

## Research Objectives
Investigate Meross Cloud API capabilities for smart plug integration, covering authentication, device management, control operations, and developer resources.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery & Official Resources
- [x] 1.1 Search for official Meross Cloud API documentation
- [x] 1.2 Find Meross developer portal and account setup information
- [x] 1.3 Locate official API reference and endpoint documentation
- [x] 1.4 Search for Meross GitHub repositories and SDKs

### Phase 2: Authentication & Access
- [x] 2.1 Research authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, tokens)
- [x] 2.2 Document developer account setup process
- [x] 2.3 Investigate API access requirements and approval process
- [x] 2.4 Identify security protocols and authentication flow

### Phase 3: API Endpoints & Operations
